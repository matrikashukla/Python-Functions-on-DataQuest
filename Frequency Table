QUESTION :

Write a function named freq_table() that generates a frequency table for any column in our iOS apps data set.
The function should take the index number of a column in as an input (name the parameter as you want).
Inside the function's body:
Loop through the apps_data data set (don't include the header row) and extract the value you want by using the parameter (which is expected to be an index number).
Build the frequency table as a dictionary.
The function should return the frequency table as a dictionary.
Use the freq_table() function to generate a frequency table for the user_rating column (the index number of this column is 7). Store the table in a variable named ratings_ft.

ANSWER :

opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)
def freq_table(index):
    column = []
    for c in apps_data[1:]:
        t = c[index]
        column.append(t)
    f = {}
    for p in column:
        if p in f:
            f[p]+=1
        else:
            f[p]=1
    return f
ratings_ft = freq_table(7)
print(ratings_ft)
