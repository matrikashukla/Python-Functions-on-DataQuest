Write a function named freq_table() that generates a frequency table for any list.

The function should take in a list as input.
Inside the function's body, write code that generates a frequency table for that list and stores the table in a dictionary.
Return the frequency table as a dictionary.
Use the freq_table() function on the genres list (already defined from the previous screen) to generate the frequency table for the prime_genre column. Store the frequency table to a variable named genres_ft.


ANSWER :

opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
from csv import reader
read_file = reader(opened_file)
apps_data = list(read_file)

def extract(index):
    column = []    
    for row in apps_data[1:]:
        value = row[index]
        column.append(value)    
    return column

genres = extract(11)

def freq_table(l):
    list = {}
    for c in l:
        if c in list:
            list[c]+=1
        else:
            list[c] = 1
    return list
genres_ft = freq_table(genres)
